# XFR Core Member Agreement 2016

* Becoming a Member

You can choose to become a Member:

* with the agreement of the existing Collective. 

* after attending 2 consecutive XFR Collective monthly meetings.

* if you commit to at least a 6 month term as an active Member

If you decide you can’t commit to all the work that is required of members IT’S OK!! You can still be part of XFR Collective as a volunteer, advisor, or partner!

* As a Member...

* You attend all monthly meetings. (Of course everyone has an emergency from time to time-- but since we only meet as a group once a month, it’s important that we each make the greatest effort to attend those meetings.) (2.5 hours, once a month)

* You join at least 1 subcommittee per month, and meet and work regularly with your fellow subcommittee members throughout the month on ongoing projects (  ~3-4 hours a week).

* You are encouraged to participate in at least 1 video transfer session a month. These take place Monday nights at member Andrea Callard’s 5th floor walk-up studio in Tribeca. (We may/hope to create alternative transfer locations in the future.) (3 hours per month.)

* You are encouraged to contribute to our blog and our social media presence.

* You have an equal voice in the collective’s decision-making. You can propose new ideas/initiatives for the collective and have them considered.

* You behave respectfully toward all members of the group and our partners.

* You represent XFR Collective externally (in-person and electronically) in a way that reflects the [mission](https://xfrcollective.wordpress.com/) and values of the collective.

* You post your bio to the website.

* You have access to XFR’s electronic accounts (gmail, Google Docs, Slack, dropbox, Internet Archive...) (We will send you a document with info about how to sign up/access these tools once you decide you wish to join the group.)
